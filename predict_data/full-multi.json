If two or more people are of the same age, they are sorted randomly within that subgroup.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Relevant Information**\n\n- The ages of the 12 idosos are given.\n- Jo\u00e3o's age is 70 years old.\n- We need to find the probability that Jo\u00e3o is the seventh person in line to receive his restitui\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\n**Step 3: Determine Possible Outcomes for Jo\u00e3o's Position**\n\nTo be the seventh person, there must be exactly six people younger than Jo\u00e3o.

This option is incorrect because we have descriptions of potential graphs.\n\n- **Option B** describes a profit curve with a maximum at 15 units, indicating the optimal production level for highest profit. This aligns well with the typical behavior where profit initially increases and then decreases after reaching an optimal point due to increasing costs outpacing revenue gains.\n\n- **Option C** suggests a graph in the shape of an \"S\". While this could be plausible in some contexts (e.g., logistic growth), it doesn't typically describe standard cost-revenue-profit relationships, which are more often represented by parabolas or linear segments with distinct turning points.\n\n- **Option D** provides a detailed analysis consistent with a downward-facing parabola. It mentions specific calculations for maximum and minimum points, indicating a quadratic relationship typical in profit maximization problems where costs eventually outweigh revenue gains at high production levels.\n\n- **Option E** suggests an S-shaped curve due to diminishing returns, which is more common in scenarios involving biological growth or certain types of market saturation, but less so in straightforward cost-revenue analysis unless specifically stated.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe description in **Option D** provides a detailed and mathematically consistent explanation of how the profit graph would behave, with specific x-intercepts, y-intercept, and vertex calculations that align well with typical economic models.

Total voltage is the sum of individual voltages (24V). However, if one battery's positive connects to point A and its negative to point B, it wouldn't complete a circuit through the body.\n  \n- **Parallel Connection**: Batteries connected with like terminals together. Voltage remains 12V across each battery, but current capacity increases. If configured such that points A and B are across different batteries in parallel, the voltage across A and B is still 12V, not enough to cause harm unless additional factors are involved.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Series Configuration**: \n  - If both batteries are connected in series with point A on one battery's positive terminal and point B on the other's negative terminal, touching these points wouldn't complete a circuit through the body. The total voltage across the person would be insufficient to cause harm (12V per battery).\n\n- **Parallel Configuration**:\n  - If each battery is connected such that point A is on the positive terminal of one battery and point B is on the negative terminal of another, this creates two parallel paths. Each path provides a potential difference of 12V across points A and B.\n  - With moist skin reducing resistance, the current through the body could become dangerous.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe configuration that allows sufficient voltage to pass through the person's body with low resistance is when the batteries are connected in such a way that each battery contributes to creating a potential difference across points A and B. This is typically achieved by connecting them in parallel, where both contribute their 12V across the same two points.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**(E)**",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\n- **Scenario**: A digital soccer game is shown with players Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, and Q6 on one team.\n- **Objective**: Identify which player receives the ball from Q1 such that angle AQnB equals angle AQ1B.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Given Information\n\n- Player Q1 has possession of the ball.\n- Players Q2 to Q6 are potential receivers.\n- The angles formed by the lines connecting these players with points A and B (goalposts) must be equal for the pass to occur.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Correct Player\n\n- **Geometry**: We need to find a player whose position forms an angle AQnB identical to AQ1B.\n- **Visual Inspection**: By examining the positions of the players relative to points A and B, we can determine which player's position mirrors Q1's position in terms of angular geometry.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\n- **Observation**: From the description and typical geometric setups in such problems, if the setup is symmetrical or follows a pattern where angles are mirrored, only one other player will have an angle equal to AQ1B.\n- **Result**: Based on symmetry and typical problem setups like this, Q2 is the player whose position forms an identical angle with A and B as Q1 does.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe correct alternative based on the analysis is:\n\n**(A) Q2**\n\nThis solution assumes that the visual or geometric setup provided in the image leads to Q2 being the only player satisfying the condition of having an equal angle AQnB compared to AQ1B.",

The graph indeed forms two linear parts, one increasing and one decreasing, which can be interpreted as an isosceles triangle when viewed from above.\n   - **Semicircle (E)**: A semicircle would imply a continuous curve rather than straight lines. The graph shows linear segments, not curved ones.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the description and analysis, option (D) \"Isosceles Triangle\" is correct because the trajectory forms two equal-length segments with constant slopes in opposite directions, resembling an isosceles triangle when viewed from above.\n   \nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**(D)**",

This strongly suggests that none of the given options would achieve the necessary voltage.\n\n\n\n**Important Note:** Without a clear diagram or precise reaction information, it's impossible to be 100% certain.

The key piece of information is the angle (30 degrees) between the diagonal of this rectangle and the base of the cylinder. We need to find the height of the cylinder.\n\n**Why Simple Trigonometry Isn't Enough:**\n\nJust looking at the 30-degree angle and the radius doesn't directly give us the height.  The problem lies in how the strip wraps around the cylinder. The diagonal of the rectangle acts like a chord along the curved surface of the cylinder, not a straight line up the height.\n\n\n**What We Need:**\n\nTo solve this, we need to think about:\n\n* **Geometry of the Wrapped Strip:** How does the rectangular strip's shape relate to the circular cross-section of the cylinder?\n* **Relationship Between Arc Length and Height:** The diagonal of the rectangle corresponds to a portion of the cylinder's curved surface (an arc). We need to find how this arc length relates to the height.\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n\n1. **Using Calculus:** This might involve setting up an integral to represent the arc length along the cylindrical surface and relating it to the diagonal of the rectangle. Then, we could solve for the height. \n\n2. **Spherical Geometry:** If we think about the cylinder as a series of concentric circles, we could use spherical geometry principles to relate the angle, radius, and arc length.\n\n\n**Without more specific information or hints, it's difficult to provide a precise solution.** Let me know if you have any additional context or constraints!",

Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was used as the titrant, reacting with the tartaric acid. The goal is to calculate the concentration of tartaric acid in the original wine sample.\n\n**Key Information**\n\n* **Volume of NaOH used:** 8.0 mL\n* **Molarity of NaOH:** 0.10 M (moles per liter)\n* **Volume of Wine Sample:** 25.0 mL\n\n**Calculations**\n\n1. **Moles of NaOH:**\n   * Moles = Molarity \u00d7 Volume (in Liters)\n   * Moles of NaOH = 0.10 mol/L \u00d7 0.008 L = 0.0008 moles\n\n2. **Moles of Tartaric Acid:**\n   * The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between tartaric acid (H\u2082C\u2084H\u2084O\u2086) and sodium hydroxide is: H\u2082C\u2084H\u2084O\u2086 + 2NaOH \u2192 Na\u2082C\u2084H\u2084O\u2086 + 2H\u2082O\n   * From the equation, we see that 1 mole of tartaric acid reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. Therefore, the moles of tartaric acid are half the moles of NaOH:\n   * Moles of Tartaric Acid = 0.0008 moles / 2 = 0.0004 moles\n\n3. **Concentration of Tartaric Acid:**\n   * Concentration (Molarity) = Moles / Volume (in Liters)\n   * Concentration of Tartaric Acid = 0.0004 moles / 0.025 L = 0.016 M\n\n\n**Answer Choice Explanation**\n\nThe closest answer choice to our calculated concentration (0.016 M) is **(B)**. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like more explanation on any of the steps!",

        "response": "To determine which graph correctly represents the height of water in an upside-down triangle as time progresses with a constant flow rate, we need to consider the shape and capacity of the container. An upside-down triangle has a base at the top and narrows towards the bottom.\n\n1. **Understanding the Container Shape:**\n   - As water fills the container from the top, initially, it occupies more horizontal space per unit of height because the base is wider.\n   - This means that for small increases in height, a larger volume (and thus more time) is required to fill that section of the triangle.\n\n2. **Graph Characteristics:**\n   - As water starts filling, the rate at which the height increases will be slower due to the wide base.\n   - As the container fills and narrows towards the bottom, less horizontal space is available per unit height increase, so the height will rise more quickly for each additional unit of time.\n\n3. **Correct Graph Type:**\n   - The graph should start with a gentle slope (indicating slow height increase) and become steeper as time progresses (indicating faster height increase).\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct graph is one where the curve starts off shallow and becomes steeper over time. This matches description (B):\n\n(B) Description:\nThe image shows a graph depicting the relationship between time and height. The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis represents height.

At this point, any additional water will start filling Reservat\u00f3rio 2.\n\n- **Reservat\u00f3rio 1 Filling:** Initially, all incoming volume \\( V \\) contributes to increasing the height \\( h \\) in Reservat\u00f3rio 1. The relationship between \\( V \\) and \\( h \\) is linear because both reservoirs are identical and have a constant cross-sectional area.

Since each team has an equal chance of winning any individual game, the probability for either team to win a single game is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nThe series can last between 4 and 7 games. If a team wins the series after 4, 5, 6, or 7 games, it must have won exactly 4 games by that point.\n\nLet's consider the scenarios:\n\n1. **Winning in 4 games:** The series is over with scores of 4-0. The probability that the team winning the first game wins all four games is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n2. **Winning in 5 games:** The series ends 4-1. The team must win 3 out of the next 4 games after winning the first one. The number of ways this can happen is \\( \\binom{4}{3} = 4 \\). Thus, the probability is \\( 4 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n3. **Winning in 6 games:** The series ends 4-2. The team must win 3 out of the next 5 games after winning the first one. The number of ways this can happen is \\( \\binom{5}{3} = 10 \\). Thus, the probability is \\( 10 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{10}{32} = \\frac{5}{16} \\).\n\n4. **Winning in 7 games:** The series ends 4-3. The team must win 3 out of the next 6 games after winning the first one. The number of ways this can happen is \\( \\binom{6}{3} = 20 \\). Thus, the probability is \\( 20 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{20}{64} = \\frac{5}{16} \\).\n\nAdding these probabilities gives us the total probability that the team which wins the first game wins the series:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{5}{16} + \\frac{5}{16} = \\frac{2}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{5}{16} + \\frac{5}{16} = \\frac{16}{16} = 1\n\\]\n\nHowever, this calculation is incorrect because it assumes the team wins the series in all scenarios. We need to consider the probability that the other team does not win the series after the first game.\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize symmetry: since each team has an equal chance of winning any game, and the series is symmetric, the probability that the team which wins the first game eventually wins the series is the same as the probability that the other team wins the series if they won the first game. Therefore, by symmetry, this probability is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n(C) \\quad 42\n\\] \n\nThe probability of the team winning the first game winning the series is \\( \\frac{42}{64} = \\frac{21}{32} \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\).",

Understand the Reaction:**\n\nThe balanced chemical equation tells us that 1 mole of tartaric acid (H\u2082C\u2084H\u2084O\u2086) reacts with 2 moles of sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of NaOH Used:**\n\n*  Molarity (M) = moles of solute / liters of solution\n*  moles of NaOH = Molarity * Volume (in Liters) \n*  moles of NaOH = 0.10 mol/L * 0.008 L = 0.0008 moles\n\n**3. Calculate Moles of Tartaric Acid:**\n\n* From the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of tartaric acid.\n* moles of tartaric acid = (moles of NaOH) / 2 \n* moles of tartaric acid = 0.0008 moles / 2 = 0.0004 moles\n\n**4. Calculate Concentration of Tartaric Acid:**\n\n*  Concentration (Molarity) = moles of solute / liters of solution\n*  Concentration of tartaric acid = 0.0004 moles / 0.025 L = 0.016 mol/L\n\n**5. Convert Molarity to Grams per Liter:**\n\n*  Grams per liter (g/L) = Molar mass * Molarity\n*  Molar mass of tartaric acid (H\u2082C\u2084H\u2084O\u2086) \u2248 150 g/mol\n*  Concentration of tartaric acid (g/L) = 150 g/mol * 0.016 mol/L = **2.4 g/L**\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the concentration of tartaric acid in the analyzed wine is closest to **(B) 2.4 g/L**.",

Profit is defined as the difference between revenue and cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} \\]\n\nFrom the description of the graph provided:\n\n- The \"Receita\" (Revenue) curve starts at zero when no items are produced, increases to a peak slightly above R$40 around 15 units, then decreases and reaches its lowest point near 30 units before increasing again.\n- The \"Custo\" (Cost) curve is consistently higher than the Revenue curve until both intersect around 15 units. After this intersection, revenue exceeds cost between approximately 20 and just over 30 units.\n\nThe profit is positive where the revenue exceeds the cost, which occurs between these two points of production:\n\n- Start of profit region: Approximately at 20 units (where revenue begins to exceed cost).\n- End of profit region: Just over 30 units (where cost begins to exceed revenue again).\n\nThus, the section of the graph that represents positive profit is where the Revenue curve is above the Cost curve, specifically between approximately 20 and just over 30 units. This part of the graph doesn't correspond directly to a new single curve labeled \"Profit,\" but rather it's the area where the vertical distance (or difference) between the Revenue and Cost curves is positive.\n\nTherefore, since the question asks which graph represents profit in terms of production quantity:\n\n- The correct interpretation is that the portion of the graph where revenue exceeds cost (between approximately 20 to just over 30 units) reflects profit.\n- Since we don't have a separate graph labeled as \"Profit,\" but rather need to identify this region on the provided graph, the answer relates to understanding these curves' interaction.\n\nGiven the options and descriptions, the correct choice is:\n\n(C): None\n\nThis selection implies that while no single curve is directly labeled as \"Profit,\" the described behavior of the Revenue and Cost curves allows us to infer where profit occurs.",

Unfortunately, the actual image is not provided in this text-based format.\n\n* **Other options rely on assumptions or misinterpretations:**\n    * (A), (B), and (D) provide specific structural answers but lack the necessary context from the image. \n    * (E) states the correct answer is \"A\" without explaining its reasoning.\n\n**Therefore, without the visual information of the reaction progress graph, we cannot definitively identify structures I, II, and III.**  The safest answer is (C), acknowledging that the question requires visual analysis for a complete solution. \n\n\n\n\n",
