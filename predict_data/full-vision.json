However, this specific data isn't provided in the table.\n\nConsidering that both solutions have an ideal pH range between 5.5 and 6.5, let's analyze what could be done to adjust the pH if it deviates from these values:\n\n1. If the pH is too low (acidic), more base can be added.\n2. If the pH is too high (alkaline), acid solutions might need to be used.\n\nWithout knowing which direction the pH needs adjustment, we cannot definitively choose between a specific type of solution or its concentration.\n\nGiven that none of the alternatives provided correctly answer this question based on available information:\n\n(A): None\n(B): None\n(C): None\n(D): None\n(E): None\n\nThe correct response is:\n(A)",
